If we limit the interactions of infected people to 1 (put full quarantine), then the proportion of infected people goes to 0.25. If we put it to 5 people per day, then the peak of infected people is at day 60 with approximately 70% of the people infected. If we leave it 13.4 - the normal daily interaction, then apr. 85% of the population will be infected peaking on the 20th day. The contact rate is not adjusted to specific interaction of Chinese people, therefore, the numbers should be approached with doubts. This simulation represents the overall trends of the virus and implies that only full quarantine can prevent a massive spread of the virus.
